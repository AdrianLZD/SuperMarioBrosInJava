## SUPER MARIO BROS IN JAVA
----------------------------

The goal of this project is to recreate the first part of the popular game Super Mario Bros.

It includes the implementation of:
- Physic system
- Collision detection
- Animations
- Sound system
- Concurrency execution
- Basic enemy AI

*NO EXTERNAL LIBRARIES WERE USED*, all the enemy interactions and logic was done using only the tools offered by the Java Standard Library.

This project was done near the beginning of my studies of Computer Science, but later on it was refactored to a much cleaner version.

How to run it
------------
There are two options to run the game:
- Download the project and execute **Super Mario Bros.jar**. It should work just make sure that the **res** folder is in the same location.
- Compile all the java files and execute **GameLauncher.java**

If for some reason the game does not start you can check the console to see what it is going on.

Controls
-------
- Movement with **arrows**.
- Shoot fireball with **X**.
